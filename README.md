# TUB Parking - Urban Transport Parking System

**TUB Parking** is an online platform designed for managing parking spaces, payments, and discounts for users of the Transportes Urbanos de Braga (TUB) service. Users can view available parking spaces, apply for discounts/bonuses, and manage their parking payments seamlessly. The project is split into two main parts: the **Frontend** (the user interface) and the **Backend** (the API for handling parking data and payments).
