# TUB Parking - Urban Transport Parking System

**TUB Parking** is an online platform designed for managing parking spaces, payments, and discounts for users of the Transportes Urbanos de Braga (TUB) service. Users can view available parking spaces, apply for discounts/bonuses, and manage their parking payments seamlessly. The project is split into two main parts: the **Frontend** (the user interface) and the **Backend** (the API for handling parking data and payments).

  - **HTML** - Structure of the web application.
  - **CSS** - For styling the website and creating a responsive design.
  - **JavaScript** - Used for client-side logic and interactivity.
  - **Google Maps API** - For displaying real-time available parking spots on a map and assisting users in locating them.

- **Backend**:
  - **Microservices Architecture** - The backend is structured into independent services, promoting scalability and fault tolerance.
  - **Java** - Programming language used for backend development.
  - **Spring Framework** - A comprehensive framework for building the backend API with a focus on simplicity, productivity, and robust data handling.
  - **MySQL** - Relational database for storing parking, payment, and user data.
  - **Stripe** - Payment processing system for handling parking payments.
  - **Niop** - A low-code platform that simplifies the orchestration of intelligent systems, enabling easy programming of machines integrating AI, robotics, and automation.
  - **Kafka** - A distributed messaging system designed for high-throughput, real-time data streaming and synchronization, ensuring accurate updates of parking space availability.
